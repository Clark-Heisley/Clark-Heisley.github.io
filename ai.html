<h1>Rebuilding Elizabot</h1>

        <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>After learning about ElizaBot’s “AI” system, I noticed how formal the conversations are that it’s not natural. To make the conversation with Eliza more fluid I based my customization off my brother. I renamed Eliza to my brother’s name Michael and tried to think how our conversations flow. I chose to base this on him to create a heart-to-heart conversation with a sibling rather than a conversation with a superior. Going through Eliza’s code there were several phrases I use with my brother, but not as formal. For example, the words “perhaps”, “submissive”, and others I don’t generally use when I talk to Michael.</p>
<p>With that said, I found it interesting how informal we talk as people do daily. The sentence structures that Eliza used were how we should speak. Short phrases like “going to”, or “want to” I switched to “gonna” and “wanna” because that’s how I text and talk to my brother. I think it’s also worth mentioning that my brother and I attempt to shorten our words but it’s the opposite for our phrases. Instead of saying goodbye we would say “catch ya later” or “see ya later” maybe because it’s fitting to the formality of our relationship?</p>
<p>Going back to Eliza, when I initially started a conversation with her, every response was too literal. If she asked if something was bothering me and I said no, her response would be something like, “are you just saying that?” It’s common courtesy if you interact with someone in public to ask how they’re doing. Normally, that person will say they’re doing okay even if they’re not. When someone does tell you they’re not okay, it’s almost taboo when that happens. Therefore, when Eliza is asking those types of questions, it doesn’t feel like a real conversation.</p>
