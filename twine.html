        <h2>Creative Choices</h2>
        <p>As I was creating my Twine game, I wanted to go with something simple. I decided to go with the choose your own adventure path based on the game Oregon Trail. The simplicity of games has gone away over the years with the advancement in technology and endless possibilities in the game creating realm. Creating this game wasn’t as simple as the game itself is. I had to lay out different outcomes based on the different decisions one will make on one’s personal journey.
I wanted to make a game that required critical thinking on a surface level. What I mean by that is anyone from an elementary student to an adult could play this game that will challenge their thinking abilities. When you begin the game, you will insert your name to make it a more personalized experience. You will start out with one hundred dollars that will need to last your whole journey. The journey lasts seven days and the objective is to get you and your group, that will consist of five people, to all survive. All that is left before you start the game is beginning your journey.
Throughout each day there will be options to choose from such as buying supplies or not buying supplies. Every choice you make will have a consequence whether it’s good or bad. Once you decide you can’t go back, and I did this because I want this to challenge our thinking abilities. Creative thinking is also something I want to instill indirectly because while this game is simple, I want the ins and outs of my game to be complex. Depending on the choices you make, it will guide you to a certain version of the way your journey will play out.
Certain decisions you will make will alter the outcome of your journey. There will be other decisions you can make that allow you to dictate what your outcome will be with lots of wiggle room. This resonates with real life because we can make certain decisions that can limit the little control we already have with our lives. We also can make decisions that can lead to more opportunities and give us more freedom in our future choices. With that said, my game is based on life and trying to survive what the world throws at us much like the events that will take place.
When you reach the end of your journey you will be shown the potential outcomes that could’ve been. Everyone takes a different path in life that ends with different outcomes that are because of things we can and can’t control. There is a way to make it through your journey will all five members including yourself by making the right choices. I designed this game so that there is a path you can take where everyone survives, but there isn’t a perfect roue. I did this because you’re allowed to make mistakes you can come back from in life. Therefore, with minimal errors you can still recover and survive your seven-day journey.
