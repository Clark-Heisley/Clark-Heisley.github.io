<h1>Text Analysis Project</h1>
<h2>Reading Psychology and Emotions Texts through Text Encoding and Voyant</h2>
<p>To picture emotions must be the central aim of the photoplay. In the drama words of wisdom may be spoken and we may listen to the conversations with interest even if they have only intellectual and not emotional character. But the actor whom we see on the screen can hold our attention only by what he is doing and his actions gain meaning and unity for us through the feelings and emotions which control them. More than in the drama the persons in the photoplay are to us first of all subjects of emotional experiences. Their joy and pain, their hope and fear, their love and hate, their gratitude and envy, their sympathy and malice, give meaning and value to the play. What are the chances of the photoartist to bring these feelings to a convincing expression?</p>
<p>No doubt, an emotion which is deprived of its discharge by words has lost a strong element, and yet gestures, actions, and facial play are so interwoven with the psychical process of an intense emotion that every shade can find its characteristic delivery. The face alone with its tensions around the mouth, with its play of the eye, with its cast of the forehead, and even with the motions of the nostrils and the setting of the jaw, may bring numberless shades into the feeling tone. Here again the close-up can strongly heighten the impression. It is at the climax of emotion on the stage that the theatergoer likes to use his opera glass in order not to overlook the subtle excitement of the lips and the passion of the eyeballs and the ghastly pupil and the quivering cheeks. The enlargement by the close-up on the screen brings this emotional action of the face to sharpest relief. Or it may show us enlarged a play of the hands in which anger and rage or tender love or jealousy speak in unmistakable language. In humorous scenes even the flirting of amorous feet may in the close-up tell the story of their possessors' hearts. Nevertheless there are narrow limits. Many emotional symptoms like blushing or growing pale would be lost in the mere photographic rendering, and, above all, these and many other signs of feeling are not under voluntary control. The photoactors may carefully go through the movements and imitate the contractions and relaxations of the muscles, and yet may be unable to produce those processes which are most essential for the true life emotion, namely those in the glands, blood vessels, and involuntary muscles.</p>
<code>This effect of the surrounding surely can and must be much heightened in
the artistic &lt;venue type="stage"&gt;theater&lt;/venue&gt; play. All the stage settings of the scene ought to
be in &lt;music type="peace"&gt;harmony&lt;/peace&gt; with the fundamental emotions of the play, and many an act
owes its success to the unity of emotional impression which results from
the perfect painting of the background; it reverberates to the passions
of the mind. From the highest artistic color and form effects of the
stage in the Reinhardt style down to the cheapest melodrama with soft
blue lights and tender music for the closing scene, the stage
arrangements tell the story of the intimate emotion. But just this
additional expression of the feeling through the medium of the
surrounding scene, through background and setting, through lines and
forms and movements, is very much more at the disposal of the
photo&lt;creator&gt;artist&lt;/creator&gt;. He alone can change the background and all the surroundings
of the acting person from instant to instant. He is not bound to one
setting, he has no technical difficulty in altering the whole scene with
every smile and every frown. To be sure, the &lt;venue type="stage"&gt;theater&lt;/venue&gt; can give us
changing sunshine and thunderclouds too. But it must go on at the slow
pace and with the clumsiness with which the events in nature pass. The
&lt;film type="silent film"&gt;photoplay&lt;/film&gt; can flit from one to the other. Not more than one sixteenth of
a second is needed to carry us from one corner of the globe to the
other, from a jubilant setting to a mourning scene. The whole keyboard
of the imagination may be used to serve this emotionalizing of nature.

<p>Throughout this text analysis project, I realized how much I can learn about a whole text by dissecting a small part of it. I chose the document “Photoplay” as my main corpus, and I built off that. I used a site called “Project Gutenberg” and after going through it, I found work by Hugo Münsterberg. His documents were about psychological studies and there was one that caught my eye. His book “The Photoplay” was interesting to me because of the research that is done through films creating emotional and cognitive experiences through viewers. By reading these texts, we can learn how acting was approached from a psychological perspective in the 1930s.</p>
<p>I enjoy films that I can relate to and when I can feel a connection with the story or individual characters. I also found some of his other pieces like “The Americans” to be interesting diving deeper into motivations and absolutes that define the American character. This book is about what it means to be American and how our psyche affects our perception. A big part of why I chose these types of reading is because I take pride in my mental health and want to continuously improve it. I had hoped to have a better understanding of “Photoplay” throughout this assignment, and I believe I have.</p>
<p>After dissecting around seven hundred fifty lines of text from Photoplay, I learned how a small amount of text can explain a story. When I was doing the mark-up for my corpus, there were key terms that helped me comprehend more information I may have missed if I was casually reading the document. The main idea of this section was how actors and spectators perceive performances based on the style it’s presented. I found it interesting that theatrical performances hold an audience’s attention span longer compared to an on-screen performance.</p>
<p>What I’ve learned through the markup process of my chosen text is how keyword and phrases add additional information. Photoplay was broken up into larger paragraphs with paragraph breaks. Marking the paragraph breaks will help me break down the text more efficiently. There are two chapters implemented into the document, so I added one section break to clarify the ending and beginning of the chapters. I clarified uncommon words for general audiences so that they might not be familiar with terms related to acting and psychology. This process showed the impact life experience has on an actor’s emotions. Emotions primarily come from words, expressions, and body language. Cameras play a role in emphasizing emotions in actors or in a scene, which I never considered before.</p>
<p>In the second section/chapter of the document, it discusses photoplay and the effects on spectators rather than the actors. This section focuses on the connection between the entire mental mechanism and the images seen on the screen. In theater it’s different than on screen because the actors seem to have more of an impact on how it affects spectators. They describe theater actors as “real plastic men” that I found to be interesting. Theater also offers a rawer performance whereas on a screen we can get distracted by our thoughts and imagination.</p>
<p>In this document, I found things like the way our emotions are swayed by an actor delivers a line or their body language. It was difficult to find aspects of this document to mark up because there wasn’t a clear way to identify what I took from reading. With that said, I found tools from Voyant that made it easier for me to mark things to help other readers understand what I took from it. The diversity that is shown in photoplay I found to be fascinating because we live in a world today that is more diverse than ever before. It’s interesting how different groups around the world can come together and perform together in a theater and/or an on-screen production.</p>
<p>Exploring Voyant helped me dive deeper into my corpus and dissect in between the lines. There were several ways to find use of the tools on the website to find what words were used often or phrases. For example, under summary, the highest word counts from my corpus were life at one thousand one hundred seventy-five, American at one thousand one hundred forty-four, new at one thousand thirty-four, time eight hundred eight-eight, and work eight hundred forty-six. The most common phrase that occurred twice with the longest length thirteen words was "I didn't try to change anybody else's opinion I just kept my own".</p>
<p>Looking at the cirrus tab, moving the scale to twenty-five, you can see that American and life are the most popular with their word counts only being thirty-one in difference. If you go to the terms tab under trend you can see that the relative frequencies are around two thousand nine hundred in difference. What I found interesting was the collocates tab because it shows the keyword term that occurs around the collocate. The word new is used multiple times as the keyword term and collocate throughout the corpus. Looking through the context tab, you can easily locate a term and the context around it from the left and right sides. I think it's also useful to have the document listed to catch certain information that may have been missed from simple reading.</p>
<p>There were some aspects of Voyant that were confusing and made it hard to track the date for the documents. The links tab shows what words are used the most, and it also shows how certain words are related to each other. If you move the scale over, you will see a cluster of words entangled together making it hard to read. Under the Bubblelines tab the dataset is laid out like the one we've seen from our first unit. Due to more data being tracked from this corpus, it makes it difficult to analyze because the bubbles overlap. If you look at the TermsBerry tab all the circles are the same size, which is deceiving when you're looking at the word counts. When you lower the scale to make it easier to read, there's hardly any data being shown.</p>
<p>In summary, the Text Analysis Project demonstrated how the encoding process and using sites like Voyant helped me absorb more information than traditional reading. I didn’t read the entirety of the Photoplay, but throughout the mark-up process I carefully found as much detail as I could. I believe if I read the whole document, I would’ve skimmed through it, missing out on information. Taking a small section and understanding it in its entirety gave me an idea of the whole document. I believe this information about psychology is important for everyone to understand even if it’s in an acting/performance setting.</p>
